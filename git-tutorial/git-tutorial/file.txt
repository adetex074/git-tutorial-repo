Invitation to wedding 

 hope you’re doing well! 

I wanted to ask if you’d be interested in being my plus-one for a wedding I’m attending next month.

 It’s on 12th of june  at bristol, and it promises to be a really nice event with great food, music, and a fun crowd.

I’d love for you to come along if you’re available and up for it. 

I think we’d have a great time together! But of course, no pressure at all if you’ve got other plans or just don’t feel like it. Just thought I’d check and see if you’d be interested.

Let me know what you think when you get a chance!
